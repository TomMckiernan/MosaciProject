Architectural Discussion

As of 24/08/2018

Two architectural pattern are being considered at this time and they have consequences 
on the languages that will be used

MVC pattrn
Angular

MVC
Extensive experince (Both in unversity in second year, and was the pattern used in the project 
i workded on in my year in industry)
Would require the use of C#, js, jquery, html possible mongoDB or sql.
Would use a testing framework employing mstest which i have experience in.
Could use visual studio however has the drawback of lack of cross playtform being windows and linux


Problems 
This project likely to have heavy focus on UI.
Slower application in comparsion to Angular application

Angular
Pattren which uses manly html and typescript
Have experienc in this two langiages and have some experience in have to structure an angular application
Works well with visula studion code aloowing to work on multiple OS systems
Use of dotnet to help the crwation of the project structure?
Dot net provides you with a defult UI structure to work with, far quicker to set uo the appliaction visually

Problem 
Far less experience in this pattren
Little knowedge of testing of typescrpt code. 
Only really doen small specfic tests on this langiage and created a full testing framework to work with the languages
Would have to research a testing framework have some familarity with mocha not to a large extent though
Dont know have to interact with a database using typescript or this archtectural structure
