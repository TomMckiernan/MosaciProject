Application Flow 

1) Home
	1.1) Contains may links in the header bar, create my miscai image is clear in the page 
	contenets but many naviagtion possibilities
	1.2) Header is main page is not the same for the rest of the workflow
2) Chose your big picture
	2.1) Select the location of the the big picture
	2.2) One of the options is local storage and they are allowed integration so 
	the windows file broweser loads up on requets and allows you the select the image
		This bring up the problem of OS that will be supported is there a differece in the way this integration will 
		have to be done for linux and windows
		Also in local browser only valid format files are displayed 
	2.3) Also allows the select of image to come from one of the following 
		Facebook, Instagram, Google, Links. 
		This would seem like on opportunity for a separta efeature whose the mvp is complete
	2.4) The header of the page aftre the create my mosaic image is press is kept the same for the rest oof the workflow
	2.5) Link on the page for instructions to get the best results
	2.6) Once image is successfully uploaded it is displayed on full on the page
		On first view would be better to not do this maybe a tooltip with the image or linked 
		to view it rather than changing the page structure.
		
3) Add small picture same page structure as previous page 
	3.1) Includes same location options
	3.2) In local storage select a location rather than specific file
	3.3) Same page structure make to clear still in the same workflow
	3.4) Diffrent picture of page to indicate the user is in a different step of the workflow
	3.5) Once step this step is complete(i.e performs a colour analysis and appears to display step 2.5)
	3.6) Also displays information about the number of images supported, page is clunky no specfic sturture
		for the display of the limits results from the analysis and the images that have been currently uploaded.
		Doesn't seems optimum and requires scrolling and no real reason why it is there.
		
4) Creates the image mosaic in real time once page is loaded
	4.1) Displays options to save or optimise mosacic and go back to previous steps in workflow
