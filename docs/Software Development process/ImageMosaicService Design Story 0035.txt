Image Mosaic Service Design

ImageMosaic Request
- Needs at least to pass the SmallImageIds and LargeImageIds
- Would then needs to access ImageFileIndex collection to get the file path for all of the ids passed
- In the future will be extended to pass the metadata therefore seems likely to pass imagefileindex structure

- If don't want to do this could get all the image paths client side and pass those to the image mosaic service

ImageMosaic Response
 - Needs to at least run a location for where the mosaic image is stored locally
 
ProjectService update mosaic image path and status
- Want to store the path that stores the created mosaic image
- Or could create a new collection which stores mosaic images

Generating metadata for tile files
- Use the technique in the image mosaic service

Structure for mosaic generator model
- properties needed
- Master image
- Tile image count
- Average colour for the tile files
- Master image average colour analysis
  - i.e the average colour for each tile in the image
  
  Get all imagefileindexstructure files for the id
  Get the image file index structure for the master image
  Therefore need request to get the current project structure 


Once generation pressed update status in project collection, and store the location the mosaic has been saved to.
Then perform the copy function and copy image to mosiac to image project folder.
Delete the image in this location when you delete the project
Save the mosiac image name as the project id

On generate view load need to check if project is in created stage if so find the image in mosaic image location
