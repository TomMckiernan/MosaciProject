Similaar to that of a ScrumBan development process

Use of a KanBan board
As this project is not being develped in a team, i will adjust this process to removed the association with scrum

The use of the KanBan board will allow to view the current process of ongoing stories

Each featuee that is added to the product will have a story created for it with associated acceptance critreia

Each story will will have to go through a series of stages before it is complete

To do - Each story that is created will be in this section

In progress - once development beings story will be moved into this sectrion after acceptnace criteria has been added to the story

In Review - Once developemtn is considered complete a code review will take place to make sure both code is correct and acceptance criteria have been met
	Once review is complete a note will be made on the story with suggested changes, and then another comment once rview has been addressed

In Integration - Once reviewed the story branch will be merged into master and will only advance if build is successful and all tests pass

In Quantification - documentaion is written for the story and added to the project

Complete - the story is considered complete.
